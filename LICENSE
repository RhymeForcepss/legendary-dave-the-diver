- ESP: fish (all species: common, rare, legendary, boss fish), monsters (sharks, jellyfish, octopuses, sea serpents, boss creatures), loot crates, treasures, hidden caves, sea creatures, weak points on fish/monsters highlighted  
- Updates post-DLC/patch (new chapters, new fish species, new restaurant upgrades, new mini-games, new staff members)  
- No key/sub — loader style
